    "- The main parameter of Linear models is the regularization parameter, called alpha in regression models and C in LinearSVC and LogisticRegression.\n",
    "- Large values for alpha or small values for C means simple models.\n",
    "- Usually C and alpha are searched for on a logarithmic scale.\n",
    "- We also need to decide to either go with L1 regularization or L2 regularization.\n",
    "- Use L1 if we know that only few of the features are important, otherwise default to L2.\n",
    "- As L1 uses only few features it is easier to explain which features are important to the model and what the effects of these features are"
