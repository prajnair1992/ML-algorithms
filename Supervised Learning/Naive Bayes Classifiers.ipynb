    "They are a family of classifers that are quite similar to the linear models. However, they tend to be faster in training. The price paid for this efficiency is that **naive Bayes models often provide generalization performance that is slightly worse than that of linear classifiers** like Logistic Regression and Linear SVC."

    "- **MultinomialNB and BernoulliNB** have a single parameter, **alpha**, which controls model complexity.\n",

    "- A large alpha means more smoothing, resulting in less complex models. \n",
    "- The algorithm’s performance is relatively robust to the setting of alpha, meaning that setting alpha is not critical for good performance. However,**tuning it usually improves accuracy somewhat.\n",
